## üßê What's inside?

This is the source code for my personal blog website https://www.danielleheberling.xyz Feel free to submit a PR for any improvements and especially if you see any typos in my posts.

Note that I've mostly just used the Gatsby starter, so some of the code in this repo might [not be reflective of my personal coding style](https://github.com/deeheber/danielle-heberling-dot-xyz/issues/11).

## üöÄ Quick start

1.  **Clone the repository**

    ```sh
    # cd into the directory location you'd like first
    git clone https://github.com/deeheber/danielle-heberling-dot-xyz.git
    ```

1.  **Start developing.**

    This site is built with the nodeJS version specified in the `.nvmrc` in mind. Other version might work, but it's not guaranteed.

    Navigate into the site‚Äôs directory and start it up.

    ```sh
    cd danielle-heberling-dot-xyz/
    npm i
    npm start
    ```

    Note: If using npm v7 or above add the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag to `npm i` per [Gatsby's suggestion](https://v4.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/migrating-from-v3-to-v4/#update-gatsby-version)

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `danielle-heberling-dot-xyz` directory in your code editor of choice and edit files. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

_Note:_ Due to [an open bug](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/38108) you might need to run `npm run clean` if you run into an error when running `npm start`.
