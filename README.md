## üßê What's inside?

This is the source code for my personal blog website. Not published to the internet yet, but will be at danielleheberling.xyz when mostly complete. Feel free to submit a PR for any improvements and especially if you see any typos in my posts.

## üöÄ Quick start

1.  **Clone the repository**

    ```sh
    # cd into the directory location you'd like first
    git clone https://github.com/deeheber/danielle-heberling-dot-xyz.git
    ```

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new site‚Äôs directory and start it up.

    ```sh
    cd danielle-heberling-dot-xyz/
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `danielle-heberling-dot-xyz` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!
