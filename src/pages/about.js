        <p>
          Career wise, I used to work in tech support. I enjoyed helping customers; however, I felt that my
          job centered around asking engineers to fix bugs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because of my desire to provide a better customer experience and to take matters into my own hands,
          I taught myself how to code and became a software engineer.
        </p>
        <p>
          I enjoy using Typescript, GraphQL, and AWS serverless services. I'm always open to learning new
          technologies if it makes sense for the project or matches my interest.
