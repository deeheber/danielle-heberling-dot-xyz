                  Throughout my entire life, I questioned why and how things work with a strong desire to make them better.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Career wise, I used to work in tech support for <a href='https://support.apple.com/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>AppleCare</a> and then <a href='https://www.squarespace.com/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Squarespace</a>. I loved helping customers; however, I discovered that my job centered around asking an engineer to fix a bug or UX issue.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Because of my desire to provide a better customer experience and to take matters into my own hands, I began teaching myself how to code and became a software engineer. Currently working on a cloud-based connect, develop and deployment solution for cellular and bluetooth low energy IoT devices at <a href='https://nrfcloud.com/#/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Nordic Semiconductor</a>.
