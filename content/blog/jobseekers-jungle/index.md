It's the year 2022 and "the Great Resignation" is all over the news. Many companies have lots of work and not enough employees to do it, resulting in lots of open job postings.

I fit the general profile of senority (whatever that means) and have technical skills that many of these places are seeking (or say they're seeking). I'm unhappy at my current job and decide to take a look at what's out there.

> Easy right? ...think again.

I won't name companies publicy out of professionalism, but you know who you are. Here's some lowlights of my most recent job hunt.

## Scenario 1

The hiring manager reached out to me on LinkedIn. The tech stack and company looked interesting, so I replied to their message. The job posting on their website did not mention specifics about the benefits, so I asked for more details during my first video call. He replied with something along the lines of "they're pretty standard benefits like you'd get at any company" and didn't go further. I pushed back and he gave a little more info, but still it wasn't exactly the amount of detail I had hoped to get.

I decided it probably wasn't a big deal and spent many hours on a take home assignment with a follow up video interview with two engineers.

After the final interview, I got a job offer! It was great news until it wasn't. Taking a look at the only health insurance plan that they offered, I had to seek out care in a state across the country to be considered "in netwok". Note the job was listed as remote...perhaps they were a newly remote company 🤷‍♀️ ? Regardless, I need good health insurance that'll cover me when I need it.

I declined the offer, disappointed that my time and the people who interviewed me's time was wasted.

## Scenario 2

I received a message from an in house recruiter on a startup job site. I replied and we set up a time for a video call. The interview time comes and ... I'm sitting in a Zoom room alone. No email nor notification that they needed to reschedule.

A week later the same recruiter messaged me asking if I wanted to reschedule the interview. No apology for completely ghosting me...nothing else. I decided to decline the second interview.

## Moral of the Stories

There are a lot more terrible interview situations that I could talk about...but this post would be too long.

**To companies hiring:** this post isn't meant to shame specific companies, but to let you know that candidates judge you by your interview process. If you can't get your sh\*t together to properly interview a candidate or communicate important things like comp, benefits, or job expectations you'll miss out on hiring some good candidates.

**To people currently seeking a new position:** know that there are lots of things outside of your control. Just because a recruiter ghosts you or chooses to act unprofessionally doesn't mean that you aren't worthy of a good job. It's clicé, but ignore that imposter syndrome and keep showing up. You'll find something eventually.

If there's anything I can do to help you out let me know. I've been there before many times and it's not easy. Lots of people talk publicly about their new job offers, but rarely speak about the journey getting there which can result in false thinking that getting a job is easy. It is not.

> Disclaimer: I acknowledge that it takes a lot of personal privilege to be able to decline a job offer and/or be picky about which companies to apply to.
