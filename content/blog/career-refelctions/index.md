Growing up, I was given advice from adults often. It was typically some variant of:
- Go to college
- Respect authority
- Work hard
- You'll be rewarded

Early on in my career, I followed this advice and it didn't work for me. I could write an entire book on the details, so will spare you the reasons/situations in this blog post.

On top of this bad advice, I found that in American culture that the first things people will often ask when meeting someone for the first time is what they do for a living. Depending on how you respond (company and position) will result in judgement that is sometimes accurate and sometimes not.

As my career progressed, I've decided that I aspire to have a legacy beyond the company that I work for and my job title and came up with these five core first principles.

1. **Be kind to people no matter what their position is in the overall hierarchy.** This includes both official heiarchy such as at a company and social heiarchy in a community setting. You never know when circumstances might change and when you might run into that individual again. I've mentored people who have exceeded my technical level of expertise as well as seen people who worked for competitors now working as a coworker.

2. **Work in public.** Share your challenges with others. It's highly possible it can help someone else out to know they aren't alone. Knowledge isn't pie...just because someone else has more of it doesn't mean that you have less. A rising tide lifts all boats.

3. **Approach disagreement with a curious mind.** Don't join a conversation expecting to "win" or to "be right." Ask questions if someone else's perspective doesn't make sense to you. You might not end up agreeing in the end, but it's likely you'll learn something new.

4. **Don't jump to technology to solve a problem unless it's the best tool for the job.** I've worked many places where tech was thrown at problems in an attempt to solve them. These situations ended up being more confusing with the root cause of the original problems unaddressed.

5. **Leave things better than you found them.** Most individuals apspire to change the world, but it is highly challenging to do this as an individual. At the very least, we can do our part to improve the current situation.

While thinking through these core principles, I've come to the conclusion that community is what's kept me here in tech. To me, community looks like coworkers, colleagues I met at community events, people who user the things I build (customers), and more. I've gotten to where I am because people were willing to take a chance on me (major shoutout to Jinsy, Charles, and Tanya for hiring me into my first developer job). Moving forward, I'd love to pay it forward by taking a chance on others and doing whatever I can to lift others up.
