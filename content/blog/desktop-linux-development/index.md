## My Background

Heavy disclaimer that this post details my personal experiences using Pop!\_OS for software development. Depending on your needs and tool chains, it's possible your experience might differ. For this reason, here's my background and the tools that I generally use for software development:

- Node/JavaScript/TypeScript
- AWS Serverless services
- AWS SAM
- AWS CDK

## Why Switch Away from MacOS

Apple does a wonderful job of controlling the entire ecosystem that encompases both the hardware and software of its devices. This is wonderful since things "just work"; however, if you want to go beyond that and want more flexibility it might not be the best choice.

I was finding myself wanting to be able to upgrade my computer's RAM quite a few times and many Apple devices solder it to the logic board. You then have the option of 1. Buying a new logic board (almost the cost of a new computer) or 2. Buying a new computer. I didn't like these choices and decided to check out alternatives.

I should also mention a disclaimer that I formerly worked at Apple. I feel somewhat conflicted supporting a corporation that did not treat me well during my time as an employee. No judgements on those who do choose to use Apple products since everyone has their unique reasons...this is just a thought present in my head everytime I use an Apple product.

## What is Pop!\_OS

The last time I used a Windows machine was Windows XP. A lot has changed since then, and I was hesitant to go back since I never really enjoyed Windows.

This is what gave me the idea to check out Linux. It's open source and there's many different distros one can choose from (could be a pro or a con depending on how you look at it). Plus, from being a professional software engineer I was familiar with the command line.

I eventually settled on Pop!\_OS because

- it's based on Ubuntu, a very common distro that has lots of documentation and an active community
- it had a very similiar UI to MacOS - what I'm already familiar with
- with the power of Linux, I could use `apt-get` to install or I could use the Pop Shop that comes with this distro which was similar to the Mac App store

## My Setup

Here's what I installed on my new Pop!\_OS machine

- [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) - a tool to install and switch to different versions of node easily
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - a code editor that I downloaded from the Pop shop
- [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)
- [SAM CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install-linux.html) - the documentation suggests one could install this via Homebrew...but the idea of using Homebrew on a Linux machine feels somewhat misguided to me. I just downloaded the file and ran the install that way.
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) - I followed the instructions to install Docker Engine on Ubuntu; however, it looks like there's a Docker Desktop for Linux in GA now. üéâ

## Conclusion

If you use similar tools that I do, you'll notice that not much has changed to install. You just have to follow the Linux (sometimes Ubuntu) specific directions.

If you too would like to get out of Apple's "walled garden" and go further with your development, I'd highly recommend trying Pop!\_OS. I've been using it as my daily driver now for about a year and have not had many issues. I'll admit, I was initially very hesitant since I was highly familiar with MacOS...but this has been a great upgrade in my life.

Maybe next year will be the year of Linux on the desktop. üòù
