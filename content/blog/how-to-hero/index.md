Ever since I was named an AWS Hero, lots of people have been asking me how they can become an AWS Hero.

**In my opinion, this is the wrong question to be asking.**

Personally, I never had the goal to become an AWS Hero. I did and will continue to do what I'm doing now regardless of the AWS Hero title. Don't get me wrong, I am very humbled and honored to have been recognized as one by AWS, but this is not why I do what I do.

In my opinion, **the correct question to be asking is what are the rough edges and challenges in the current ecosystem and how can I share my knowledge and experiences to make it easier for others?**

For ideas and inspiration, I'd recommend looking at what AWS Heroes and AWS Community Builders are doing. Also, remember that you can do something completely new too!

You donâ€™t need permission or a fancy title to help others and to make a difference. If you aren't sharing your knowledge and experiences in public yet and would like to, please join us!

I'm looking forward to seeing what you share.
