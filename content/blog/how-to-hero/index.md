Lately, lots of folks have been asking me how they can become an AWS Hero. Instead of copying and pasting my answer, I thought it might be good to share my answer to that question publicly as a blog post.

**In my opinion, this is the wrong question to be asking.**

Personally, I never had the goal to become an AWS Hero. I did and will continue to do what I'm doing now regardless of the AWS Hero title. I am very humbled and honored to have been recognized as one by AWS, but this is not why I do what I do.

In my opinion, the correct question to be asking is what are the rough edges and challenges in the current ecosystem and how can I share my knowledge and experiences to make it easier for others?

For ideas and inspiration, I'd recommend looking at what current Heroes are doing, but also remember that nothing is stopping you from doing something completely new too.

I'm looking forward to seeing what you share. It's always refreshing to see new perspectives from the community.

You donâ€™t need permission or a fancy title to help others and to make a difference. If you aren't sharing your knowledge and experiences in public yet (and want to), please join us! I'd love to hear your voice in the larger conversation.
