## Scenario: Working on a serverless first team

Whenever we hire a new person regardless of how long they've been a professional software developer, if they're new to serverless the first question is often the same.

> "How do I run this locally on my computer?"

Sure there are plenty of tools and emulators out there that can simulate AWS on your laptop; however, I've noticed some problems personally with this approach.

- The tools are not always accurate or up to date with the latest features available in the cloud.
- The environment locally vs in the cloud will be different. Examples where drift between the two environments can occur includes things like environment variables, database connections, or permissions to access resources.
- Sometimes maintaining the tooling required for these emulation tools can be more work than repeatedly deploying your changes and testing in a sandbox cloud account. A lot of them require knowledge of Docker and Docker networking...at that point why go serverless in the first place? (My biased opinion)

## Scenario Working on a non-serverless first team

Many companies choose to use a more traditional type of server architecture such as EC2 instances RDS as the main parts of their application's architecture. Running a local version of the Node.js server against a local Postgres database is great for fast, iterative development and testing and works well most of the time.

Where this falls apart is when integrating another AWS service such as S3. I've seen many times when software developers who do not have much cloud experience, but are great at writing code do the following:

1. Authenticate with AWS using their own AWS credentials that give them administrative access to the entire account locally on their computer.
2. Run a server locally on their computer which uploads a file to an S3 bucket located in a non-prod AWS account.
3. It works!
4. They submit their code and it gets merged into the main branch.
5. The code gets deployed to a non-prod environment (staging or something similar).
6. They test uploading to the S3 bucket and it fails on the non-prod environment.
7. "I don't know what's going on because it worked locally for me!" ü§î

Someone more experienced with IAM or someone just curious with how things work while deployed pokes around AWS and realizes the permissions on the IAM role that the server is using is not the same as the permissions on the IAM role that the developer is using locally on their computer. Permissions issues fixed, ship it, done. üöÄ

## Unsolicited advice

1. Have a staging, test, and/or integration cloud environment where you can test code changes before deploying to prod. It's good for you to catch problems before your end users do.
2. If you're running servers locally as part of your development loop, authenticate with IAM using a similar role that the production server uses. This will help catch permissions issues sooner. Giving yourself admin access will cause things to work locally but not when deployed.
3. If you're working on a serverless first team, I would recommend not running your application locally. Instead, deploy your code to a sandbox account and test it there. This will help catch issues with permissions, environment variables, and other things that can cause drift between your local environment and the cloud environment. It's also a good way to get more familiar with the cloud.

## Reflections

I've seen similar variations of these scenarios play out on many different teams at different companies. I think the reason is due to developers needing to change their mindset.

Because more software applications are utilizing managed cloud services, we must change our approach to development and acknowledge that the way we've always traditionally done things is no longer the best way to do things.

Let's build better software together. Good luck out there. üí™üèª
