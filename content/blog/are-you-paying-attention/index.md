title: Are You Paying Attention?

I've been noticing a trend everytime I go out in public. Almost everywhere I look people are on their phones. We hike to a beautiful waterfall, only to find a crowd of people standing there recoding it on their phones for Instagram or whatever the hip social sharing site is. I go to a live show and wouldn't you know...the phones are out recording.

On a personal level, I've noticed this change within myself as well. I'm sitting in my living room and feel compelled to check my phone. No actual reason, just feeling the pull that I need to check my phone. This also translates to social media. Sometimes when I can't focus at work, I just open up Twitter to the endless scroll. At the end of the day, I find behaviors like this are making me feel less happy in life and more stressed/angry, so I've been actively trying to reduce this behavior.

## Apps Are Designed to be Addictive
The endless scrolling and constant notifications are designed to make users open up the app more. As a software engineer, I've been in conversations that sounded something like "well how can we design this to encourage users to [insert action that makes the company money here]." I get that it's a business and there's a need to make money, but this makes me feel somewhat gross.

Free social media sites in particular are probably the worst offenders. The model of how they make money is through advertisers, so they're incentivized to keep you on their site as long as they can in order to collect as much data about you to share with advertisers as well as hoping your eyes read the ads to prompt you to purchase something you normally wouldn't.

Outrage and arguing seems to drive engagement, so many of these sites organize your feed in a way so posts that will outrage you into engaging with the person you're mad at gets prioritized. On top of that everything just feels dehumanized because we're communicating in text and can't actually see the person we are communicating with.

As far as I'm concerned, I'd love to see surveilance capitalism end because it is ruining many people's ability to pay attention to what's important in life. The first step is realizing what is going on, so we can work together to create meaningful change in society.

## Coping Mechanisms I've been Using
In the meantime, I still need to live in this world the way it is. Here's some techniques I've used to help get some of my ability to focus on things that matter back. Perhaps they'll also help you?

### Take a break from computer screens
It's super easy to start scrolling and just lose track of time. I really like the app [flow](https://flowapp.info/) to remind me it's time to take a break.

### Go on walks
Getting outside is great, but it's also great to do this without a phone. Just let your mind wander as you walk around and it'll help you to unwind as well as come up with some [shower thought](https://www.therighttoshower.com/ethical-living/what-are-shower-thoughts-and-why-we-have-them) ideas.

### Meditation
Taking some time out of the day to just focus on breathing has been helpful for me. It calms me down and helps to center my mind. There's lots of ways you can do this. I personally enjoy using [headspace](https://www.headspace.com/).

### Read books and physically write down notes
The medium in which you consume content influences how you consume it. For example social media posts are generally short blips of thoughts. So your mind spends time hopping around from thought to though. I've found reading entire books to be helpful. It's on cohesive thought and it is generally free of distractions such as advertising.

Whenever I need to take notes, I find physically writing things down helps me to retain the information. If I type it out on my computer, I find myself opening a second tab and navigating to various websites.

For reading and note taking I use a [Boox Nova 3](https://onyxboox.com/boox_nova3) with very few apps installed on it.

### Chase flow states
Have you ever started working on a task and just had so much fun with it that time stood still? That's a flow state. For me a good flow state is sitting down in front of the piano and practicing some songs. Whenever I get caught up in the scroll of social media, I sit and think to myself "what could I be doing now that would be more rewarding" and then I go do it. Chase those flow states for maximum happiness in life.

## Closing
If you're like me and have also been having troubles focusing on things that matter in your life, know that you're not alone and it's not completely your fault. There are small things that you can do; however, we really need a big societal change as well.

This post was inspired from my life experience as well as reading [Stolen Focus](https://stolenfocusbook.com/). If you're interested in learning more, this book is a great place to start.
