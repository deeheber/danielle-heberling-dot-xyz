## The Project

We were tasked to build a "smart" shopping list over the course of 10 weeks. During this time there was lots of pair programming, async communication over slack, code review, demos, and retrospectives.

### Features

- Login and customized views based off of whom logged in
- Create a new list
- Add an item to the list and set the urgency level (soon, kind of soon, not so soon)
- Delete an item from the list
- Mark an item as purchased
- Search a list for an item
- Share a list with another user
