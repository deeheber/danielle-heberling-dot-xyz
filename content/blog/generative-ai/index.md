**I'm worried about generative AI.**

No this post isn't about the common objections I've been seeing in the discourse. Things like bias in the models and people's jobs being replaced. Although they are very important things to monitor.

I'm concerned with AI monopolizing the focus of companies.

Take the big tech companies for example. In the news there are reports of multiple layoff rounds but also news of higher rates of investment (both money and people resources) in AI than ever before. These large companies have big ecosystems that many folks depend on. Does this mean since the main focus is AI that there will be less focus on these core service offerings? Does this mean that service reliability will degrade as time goes on?

On the other end of the tech spectrum, we have tech startups. Take a look at any startup's website and it's highly likely that AI is mentioned somewhere. If they use one thing that could be considered AI, they aren't afraid to brag about it. I'm seeing so many subpar chatbots being built while their marketing tells me this is "cutting edge" and this is the solution to my problems that I didn't know I had.

Disclaimer that these are my opinions based off of observing the world around me. I do not have data to present as evidence. This is all based off of vibes. I sure hope my vibes are wrong and that I'm overreacting to all of this and should take my tin foil hat off. Perhaps this my "get off my lawn" moment.

Time will tell.

There's still lots of innovation without AI that is needed in this world. AI has promise and has the potential to be helpful with specific tasks, but let's not forget that we should attempt to solve problems that already exist before bringing in tools that have the potential to cause even more problems.
